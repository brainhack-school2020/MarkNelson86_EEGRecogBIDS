  Welcome to EEG_Oddball_BIDS by Mark Nelson, a project in the BrainHackSchool 2020. For this project I will be working with an existing EEG dataset collected from 1000 participants while performing a
3-stimulus oddball detection task followed by a test of object recognition. The goals of this project are:

OBJECTIVES: 

(1) Organize an existing EEG dataset according to the BIDS standard and publish in a git repository.

(2) Write a python based machine learning algorithm to predict behavioral measures (object recognition) from single trial EEG amplitude recorded at stimulus encoding.

(3) Analyze data for indidividual differences across participants and plot results using custom python based plotting scripts.

(4) Organize all code into Jupyter notebooks.



TOOLS: 
+ Jupyter Notebook 

+ Python

+ Anaconda (virtual environment)

+ nilearn (ML python package)

+ matplotlib, pandas, plotly, seaborn, bokeh (data visualization python packages)
