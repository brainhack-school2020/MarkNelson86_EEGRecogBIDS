  This script builds a SVR (Support Vector Regression) machine learning model from 
EEG data related to Oddball_Recog_2019 in order to predict object recognition
in phase 2 (recognition test) of the task from single trial EEG amplitude recorded 
in phase 1 (oddball, stimulus encoding). 

    Features:
        Single trial mean EEG amplitude 
        
    Labels:
        Behavioral outcome (Recognized: 1, not-recognized: 0)
